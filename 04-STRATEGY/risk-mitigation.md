## HIGH-SEVERITY RISKS & MITIGATION

### 🔴 RISK 1: Market Doesn't Validate
**Description**: Conversion rate <3% despite outreach. Market rejects positioning.

**Probability**: Medium (30%)  
**Impact**: Complete strategy pivot needed  
**Trigger**: <2 customers after 500 outreaches OR <3% conversion rate

**Mitigation**:
1. **Pre-validation** (Week 1):
   - Survey 20 ideal prospects before full launch
   - Ask: "Would you buy this?", "What's missing?"
   - Adjust positioning based on feedback

2. **Early signals** (Jan-Feb):
   - Track conversion rate weekly
   - If <3% by Feb 15, emergency pivot meeting
   - Prepare alternate positioning (3 versions ready)

3. **Pivot options** (If triggered):
   - Pivot 1: Focus on e-commerce instead (SECONDARY segment)
   - Pivot 2: White-label for agencies instead of direct
   - Pivot 3: Shift to optimization/consulting instead of design
   - Pivot 4: Lower price point (TIER 1 focus)

4. **Timeline**: 
   - Feb 28: Decision point
   - Mar 1-15: Implement pivot
   - Mar 15+: Test new positioning

**Contingency Budget**: R$2.000 for paid testing if needed

### 🔴 RISK 2: Churn Rate Too High
**Description**: Customers don't repeat. Lifetime value collapses.

**Probability**: Medium (25%)  
**Impact**: Business model breaks (CAC > LTV)  
**Trigger**: >15% churn rate OR <20% repeat customer rate by Q2

**Mitigation**:
1. **Prevention** (Built-in from start):
   - 30 days free support post-launch (included in price)
   - Monthly check-in calls (first 3 months)
   - NPS measurement after every project
   - Satisfaction survey (mandatory)

2. **Monitoring** (Weekly):
   - Track customer satisfaction scores
   - Document any negative feedback
   - 1:1 call with any unsatisfied customer

3. **Retention program** (If churn >10%):
   - Launch TIER 4 (maintenance/optimization monthly)
   - Referral incentives (10% commission)
   - Exclusive access to new features/services
   - VIP support tier

4. **Quality gates** (Prevent churn):
   - Max 2 revisions without charge
   - 3rd+ revision = consulting rate
   - Process improvements based on feedback
   - Quarterly business reviews (for larger clients)

5. **Target metrics**:
   - Repeat rate: >30% (by Q3)
   - NPS: >50 (by Q2)
   - Churn: <10% annually

---

### 🔴 RISK 3: Can't Deliver at Scale
**Description**: Take on too many projects, quality drops, burn out.

**Probability**: Medium (35%)  
**Impact**: Damaged reputation, low NPS, high churn  
**Trigger**: >5 projects simultaneously OR >25 hours/week delivery

**Mitigation**:
1. **Capacity management**:
   - Hard limit: 5 projects maximum concurrently
   - Average 2-3 projects per week
   - Close project intake if at capacity
   - Build 2-week backlog (planned pipeline)

2. **Process optimization**:
   - Create project templates (speed up design)
   - Use Webflow clone-able templates
   - Standardize 80% of workflow
   - Reusable component library
   - Expected time savings: 30-40%

3. **Hiring timeline** (If needed):
   - **Trigger**: 40+ customers accumulated
   - **Hire**: Part-time designer or contractor
   - **Cost**: R$3.000-4.000/month
   - **Tasks**: Handle revisions, component creation
   - **Impact**: Allows 2x capacity

4. **Outsourcing fallback**:
   - Pre-vetted freelancer network (2-3 designers)
   - Use for overflow (20% of projects max)
   - Maintain quality via review process
   - Cost: R$800-1.200 per project (vs R$3.500 revenue = margin)

5. **Scope management**:
   - Tier 1 projects: Max 1 page, limited revisions
   - Tier 2 projects: 1-3 pages, 3 revisions max
   - Tier 3 projects: Complex only if hired help confirmed
   - Say NO to scope creep (extra = consulting rate)

## MEDIUM-SEVERITY RISKS & MITIGATION

### 🟠 RISK 4: Competition Intensifies
**Description**: New competitors enter market (Figma templates, agencies, AI tools)

**Probability**: High (60%)  
**Impact**: Price pressure, harder to differentiate  
**Trigger**: 3+ new competitors emerge with similar offering

**Mitigation**:
1. **Moat building** (Compete on relationships):
   - Build personal brand (LinkedIn, thought leadership)
   - Create community (group of clients)
   - Document processes (competitive advantage)
   - Build referral network early

2. **Differentiation strategy**:
   - Premium positioning ("rare" design, not cheap)
   - Results-focus (measure & optimize)
   - Personal touch (relationships, not templating)
   - Speed (2-3 weeks, not industry standard 6-8)
   - Support (30 days post-launch, included)

3. **Pricing strategy**:
   - Don't compete on price
   - Increase price annually (quality justifies it)
   - Offer premium tiers (more revenue per customer)
   - Create loyalty (referral discounts, retention bonuses)

4. **Service expansion** (Diversify):
   - Add optimization/A/B testing service
   - Add conversion rate optimization consulting
   - Add ongoing management (TIER 4+)
   - Expand into related services

5. **Network effect**:
   - Agency partnerships (defensible)
   - Client referral loops (self-reinforcing)
   - Community building (stickiness)
   - Case study library (social proof)

**Target**: By Q3, 50% of leads from referrals (harder to copy)

---

### 🟠 RISK 5: Pricing Too Low
**Description**: TIER prices don't cover costs, margin gets squeezed.

**Probability**: Medium (25%)  
**Impact**: Unsustainable unit economics  
**Trigger**: Gross margin <70% after first 10 projects

**Mitigation**:
1. **Price testing** (Early validation):
   - Quote first 3 prospects at current prices
   - 3 prospects at +20% higher prices
   - Track acceptance rate
   - If 70%+ accept higher price → raise it

2. **Value-based pricing**:
   - Calculate customer ROI (landing page increase = X% revenue)
   - Price at 10% of their projected ROI
   - Example: +R$50k/year revenue = R$5k project price justified

3. **Dynamic pricing**:
   - Start: TIER 2 = R$3.500
   - After 10 customers: R$4.000
   - After 25 customers: R$4.500
   - After 50 customers: R$5.000
   - Rationale: Experience/demand justifies it

4. **Packaging adjustment**:
   - TIER 1 → R$2.500 (was R$2.000)
   - TIER 2 → R$4.500 (was R$3.500)
   - TIER 3 → R$10.000+ (was R$7k-10k)
   - TIER 4 → R$1.500/m (was R$500-1k)

5. **Target margins**:
   - Gross margin: >80%
   - Operating margin: >60%
   - Net profit margin: >50% (after taxes)

### 🟠 RISK 6: Marketing ROI Turns Negative
**Description**: Spending money on ads/content but no returns.

**Probability**: Low (15%)  
**Impact**: Wasted budget, slower growth  
**Trigger**: Ad spend >R$100/month without positive ROAS

**Mitigation**:
1. **Marketing approach** (Organic-first):
   - No paid ads until Q2
   - Rely on outreach + referrals (R$0 cost)
   - Build social proof first (content, case studies)
   - Only then test paid channels

2. **Content ROI tracking**:
   - Track every blog post: views → leads → customers
   - YouTube video: views → email subscribers → customers
   - LinkedIn content: engagement → messages → customers
   - If ROI negative: Stop that channel

3. **Ad testing (Q2+):**
   - Budget: R$500/month test (Jan-Jun)
   - Platform: LinkedIn (best for B2B)
   - KPI: <R$1.000 CAC
   - If not achieved after 2 weeks: Kill channel
   - Scale only if ROAS >3:1

4. **Organic prioritization**:
   - 80% effort on organic (outreach, content, referrals)
   - 20% effort on paid (if anything)
   - Break-even without any paid ads
   - Paid ads = acceleration tool, not foundation

## LOW-MEDIUM SEVERITY RISKS & MITIGATION

### 🟡 RISK 7: Key Person Dependency
**Description**: Everything depends on you. No redundancy.

**Probability**: High (almost certain)  
**Impact**: Burnout, can't scale, vulnerability  
**Trigger**: Working >50 hours/week consistently

**Mitigation**:
1. **Immediate** (Jan-Mar):
   - Set working hours limit: 45h/week max
   - Take 2 days off per week (non-negotiable)
   - Document all processes (for future hire)
   - Create standard operating procedures

2. **Short-term** (Apr-Jun):
   - Hire part-time support for admin (10h/week)
   - Or: Hire freelancer for revisions (5-10 projects/month)
   - Cost: R$1.500-2.000/month
   - Impact: Free up 10-15h/week for business

3. **Medium-term** (Jul-Sep):
   - Consider full-time junior designer
   - Cross-train on key processes
   - Delegate project delivery (you do design, they do revisions)
   - Reduce your delivery time by 50%

4. **Documentation**:
   - Process manual (120+ pages by Q4)
   - Video tutorials of key workflows
   - Client onboarding guide
   - Project delivery checklist
   - Allows easy delegation/scaling

---

### 🟡 RISK 8: Economy Downturn
**Description**: Recession. Infoprodutores stop investing in marketing.

**Probability**: Low (10%)  
**Impact**: Reduced customer acquisition  
**Trigger**: Interest rates +2%, economic news negative, customer inquiries drop >30%

**Mitigation**:
1. **Diversification** (Reduce infoproduct dependency):
   - Current: 80% infoprodutores
   - Q2+: Add e-commerce (15% + 5%)
   - Q3+: Add agencies (10%)
   - Economic downturns affect all equally, so diversify

2. **Value repositioning** (If downturn occurs):
   - Switch messaging: "Increase revenue in uncertain times"
   - Position as ROI-positive investment
   - Offer payment plans (quarterly payments)
   - Discount only with commitment (3-6 month contracts)

3. **Retention focus**:
   - TIER 4 (recurring): More stable revenue
   - Referral program: Lower CAC
   - Upsell to existing: Higher LTV
   - Build long-term relationships

4. **Cost management** (If needed):
   - Reduce marketing spend (back to organic)
   - Pause hiring plans
   - Defer non-essential expenses
   - Accept slower growth (but still profitable)
