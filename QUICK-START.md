### If Website Gets No Traffic
**Action**:
- [ ] Share on LinkedIn (get 100+ views first)
- [ ] Ask friends to visit (social proof)
- [ ] Add to email signature
- [ ] Don't rely on organic yet (focus on outreach)

### If First Project Delivery Fails
**Action**:
- [ ] Over-communicate
- [ ] Offer extra revisions (free)
- [ ] Fix it fast
- [ ] Get on call to explain improvements
- [ ] Turn complaint into testimonial

### If Running Low on Motivation
**Action**:
- [ ] Review your why (why start PRISMATIC LABS?)
- [ ] Look at first customer feedback
- [ ] Track revenue (even R$500 counts!)
- [ ] Call a friend who believes in you
- [ ] Remember: Day 1 of rest of your life
