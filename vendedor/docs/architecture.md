# Vendedor AI Architecture Foundation

## Objective

Transform the existing Vendedor AI codebase into a professional autonomous revenue engine without breaking the current operating flow.

## Current interpretation

The current system already has enough modules to support prospecting, analysis, copy generation, review, tracking, dashboarding and continuous learning. The immediate gap is not missing AI capability; it is lack of explicit contracts, naming clarity and status governance.

## Canonical agent roles

- `scout` / `scout-auto`: discover and capture leads.
- `analyzer`: enrich psychographic and commercial context.
- `copywriter`: generate first-contact messaging.
- `copy-reviewer`: improve one specific outbound message before use.
- `message-qa`: approve or reject message batches in the operating queue.
- `followup`: execute recovery and continuation logic.
- `tracker`: register pipeline movement and outcomes.
- `learner`: learn from outcomes and refine rules.
- `orchestrator` / `autopilot`: coordinate the end-to-end revenue loop.
- `dashboard-api`: expose operational visibility.
- `notion-sync`: synchronize CRM data externally.

## Canonical lead statuses

- `discovered`
- `enriched`
- `qualified`
- `message_ready`
- `qa_approved`
- `sent`
- `engaged`
- `followup_due`
- `opportunity`
- `won`
- `lost`
- `blocked`

## First refactor decisions

1. Preserve legacy intelligence modules during the foundation phase.
2. Introduce `src/` as the new professional application structure.
3. Route entrypoints through wrappers first, then migrate internals safely.
4. Rename ambiguous reviewers by responsibility, not by module number.
5. Make `src/core/tracker.js` the single authority for pipeline state movement.

## Legacy to professional map

- `1-analyzer.js` -> `src/agents/analyzer.js`
- `2-copywriter.js` -> `src/agents/copywriter.js`
- `3-cataloger.js` -> `src/core/tracker.js` with legacy compatibility wrapper
- `4-followup.js` -> `src/agents/followup.js`
- `4-reviewer.js` -> `src/agents/message-qa.js`
- `5-orchestrator.js` -> `src/core/orchestrator.js`
- `6-scout.js` -> `src/agents/scout.js`
- `6-scout-auto.js` -> `src/agents/scout-auto.js`
- `7-reviewer.js` -> `src/agents/copy-reviewer.js`
- `8-dashboard.js` -> `src/services/dashboard-api.js`
- `9-notion-sync.js` -> `src/services/notion-sync.js`
- `10-autopilot.js` -> `src/core/autopilot.js`
- `11-learner.js` -> `src/agents/learner.js`
- `12-tracker.js` -> `src/core/tracker.js` with tracker compatibility wrapper

## What changed in phase 10

- Deployment readiness entered the repo with `scripts/validate-env.js`, `.env.example` and `scripts/install.sh`.
- The package contract now exposes `preflight`, `readiness`, `install:local` and `smoke:report` scripts to reduce ad-hoc setup.
- README was tightened to make setup and remaining gaps explicit instead of pretending the product is already client-ready.
- `docs/production-readiness.md` now states the honest bar for internal operation versus external commercialization.

## Next implementation steps

1. Add a real smoke-test flow that exercises analyze -> qa -> sent -> tracker with fixture leads.
2. Add deployment target standardization, secrets handling and backup scripts.
3. Add onboarding assets, operator docs and a commercial setup flow that a client can actually use without engineering help.
4. Add observability, alerting and restore drills before claiming production-grade autonomy.
