# Vendedor AI Architecture Foundation

## Objective

Transform the existing Vendedor AI codebase into a professional autonomous revenue engine without breaking the current operating flow.

## Current interpretation

The current system already has enough modules to support prospecting, analysis, copy generation, review, tracking, dashboarding and continuous learning. The immediate gap is not missing AI capability; it is lack of explicit contracts, naming clarity and status governance.

## Canonical agent roles

- `scout` / `scout-auto`: discover and capture leads.
- `analyzer`: enrich psychographic and commercial context.
- `copywriter`: generate first-contact messaging.
- `copy-reviewer`: improve one specific outbound message before use.
- `message-qa`: approve or reject message batches in the operating queue.
- `followup`: execute recovery and continuation logic.
- `tracker`: register pipeline movement and outcomes.
- `learner`: learn from outcomes and refine rules.
- `orchestrator` / `autopilot`: coordinate the end-to-end revenue loop.
- `dashboard-api`: expose operational visibility.
- `notion-sync`: synchronize CRM data externally.

## Canonical lead statuses

- `discovered`
- `enriched`
- `qualified`
- `message_ready`
- `qa_approved`
- `sent`
- `engaged`
- `followup_due`
- `opportunity`
- `won`
- `lost`
- `blocked`

## First refactor decisions

1. Preserve legacy intelligence modules during the foundation phase.
2. Introduce `src/` as the new professional application structure.
3. Route entrypoints through wrappers first, then migrate internals safely.
4. Rename ambiguous reviewers by responsibility, not by module number.
5. Make `src/core/tracker.js` the single authority for pipeline state movement.

## Legacy to professional map

- `1-analyzer.js` -> `src/agents/analyzer.js`
- `2-copywriter.js` -> `src/agents/copywriter.js`
- `3-cataloger.js` -> `src/core/tracker.js` with legacy compatibility wrapper
- `4-followup.js` -> `src/agents/followup.js`
- `4-reviewer.js` -> `src/agents/message-qa.js`
- `5-orchestrator.js` -> `src/core/orchestrator.js`
- `6-scout.js` -> `src/agents/scout.js`
- `6-scout-auto.js` -> `src/agents/scout-auto.js`
- `7-reviewer.js` -> `src/agents/copy-reviewer.js`
- `8-dashboard.js` -> `src/services/dashboard-api.js`
- `9-notion-sync.js` -> `src/services/notion-sync.js`
- `10-autopilot.js` -> `src/core/autopilot.js`
- `11-learner.js` -> `src/agents/learner.js`
- `12-tracker.js` -> `src/core/tracker.js` with tracker compatibility wrapper

## What changed in phase 5

- Shared JSON and file operations were centralized in `src/utils/file-store.js`.
- Dashboard service now uses the shared utility layer instead of repeating file access helpers.
- Learner logic was migrated into `src/agents/learner.js` and now consumes structured tracker events in addition to message review and outcome history.
- `11-learner.js` became a compatibility wrapper to the structured learner.
- Autopilot now triggers the structured learner directly.

## Next implementation steps

1. Refactor `src/core/tracker.js` and remaining services to consume `src/utils/` consistently.
2. Align the frontend dashboard views with canonical statuses and the new learning/tracker payloads.
3. Add throughput guardrails, send quotas and quality gates for fully autonomous execution.
4. Add campaign-level orchestration for channel mix, retry policy and prioritization.
5. Remove compatibility shims only after the frontend and all automations stop depending on legacy file shapes.
